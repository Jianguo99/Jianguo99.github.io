<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a research associate in the [AMI Research Group](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/) led by Prof. [Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). 
Previously, I was a research intern in Prof. [Hongxin Wei's research group](https://hongxin001.github.io/) at the Southern University of Science and Technology.
I completed my M.S. in Computer Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University in 2024 under the supervision of Prof. [Yue Qiu](https://yuechiu.github.io/) and Prof. [Hao Wang](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/wanghao/),
and I earned my B.S. in Information and Computer Science from North China Electric Power University in 2021.

# ‚ú°Ô∏è Research Interests
My current research interests mainly focus on Conformal Prediction, Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification.
